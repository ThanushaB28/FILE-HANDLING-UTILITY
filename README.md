Task 1: Java Program to Read, Write, and Modify Text Files
File handling is one of the most important concepts in Java programming because it allows programs to store, retrieve, and modify data in external files instead of relying only on memory. Working with files provides persistence, meaning the data remains available even after the program finishes execution. This makes file handling essential for applications such as text editors, log management systems, configuration files, and databases.

In this task, the goal is to build a Java program that demonstrates reading, writing, and modifying text files. The program will allow a user to enter text, save it into a file, display the stored content, and later modify or append additional text to the same file. Through this task, we learn how to use Java’s FileReader, FileWriter, and BufferedReader classes, which provide methods for handling text files effectively.

1. Writing to a File
The first operation is writing data to a file. For this purpose, the program uses the FileWriter class. When a new file is created or an existing one is overwritten, the content typed by the user is stored permanently on disk. This demonstrates how applications like notepads or log systems store input data. Proper exception handling is included using try-catch blocks to handle possible errors such as missing permissions or invalid file paths.

2. Reading from a File
The second important functionality is reading data from a file. This allows the program to retrieve and display the contents stored previously. Java’s FileReader and BufferedReader classes are used to read text line by line, making it easier to process the data. The output is then printed to the console so that the user can confirm that the data was successfully saved and retrieved. This step is similar to how applications load configuration files or user data during startup.

3. Modifying (Appending) a File
The third operation is modifying the file by appending new data. Instead of replacing the old content, the program adds additional text at the end of the file. This is useful in real-world scenarios such as updating logs, saving chat history, or maintaining user notes. The append feature is implemented by opening the FileWriter in append mode, which prevents overwriting existing data.

4. User Interaction
The program is designed to be interactive by using the Scanner class for input. The user can type the initial text, see it stored in the file, and later add new text to demonstrate modification. The result is displayed in the console after every operation, ensuring clarity of execution.

5. Importance of File Handling
This task provides a strong foundation in file handling, which is a critical skill for Java developers. Many real-world systems rely heavily on file operations, from simple applications like text editors to large-scale systems like databases and cloud storage. Understanding how to safely read, write, and modify files ensures that programs can manage data effectively. Additionally, incorporating exception handling teaches safe programming practices when dealing with external resources.

Conclusion
In summary, Task 1 demonstrates how to implement file handling operations in Java, including reading, writing, and modifying text files. The program covers essential classes such as FileWriter, FileReader, and BufferedReader while reinforcing the importance of exception handling. Completing this task helps students gain practical experience in working with persistent storage, which is a crucial step toward building more advanced applications in Java.
